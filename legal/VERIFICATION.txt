Publishing this package on the chocolatey repository is an initiative
encouraged by the official OpenVPN authors. In the future, they even
intend to publish a daily build of OpenVPN and make this package an
official channel to distribute OpenVPN updates.

These points have been discussed in this ticket:
https://github.com/wget/chocolatey-package-openvpn/issues/2

The binaries included in this package are identical to the ones available
on the OpenVPN community website:
