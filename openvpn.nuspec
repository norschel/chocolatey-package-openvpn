        <summary>OpenVPN is a multiplatform and open source VPN server and client solution</summary>
        <description>OpenVPN is a full-featured open source SSL VPN solution that accommodates a wide range of configurations, including remote access, site-to-site VPNs, Wi-Fi security, and enterprise-scale remote access solutions with load balancing, failover, and fine-grained access-controls. Starting with the fundamental premise that complexity is the enemy of security, OpenVPN offers a cost-effective, lightweight alternative to other VPN technologies that is well-targeted for the SME and enterprise markets.

        This package will be installed with the following options:
        * `/SELECT_OPENVPN=1`             : Install OpenVPN user-space components, including openvpn.exe
        * `/SELECT_SERVICE=1`             : Install the OpenVPN service wrappers
        * `/SELECT_TAP=1`                 : Install/upgrade the TAP virtual device driver
        * `/SELECT_OPENVPNGUI=1`          : Install OpenVPN GUI by Mathias Sundman
        * `/SELECT_ASSOCIATIONS=1`        : Register OpenVPN config file association (*.ovpn)
        * `/SELECT_OPENSSL_UTILITIES=1`   : Install the OpenSSL Utilities (used for generating public/private key pairs)
        * `/SELECT_EASYRSA=1`             : Install OpenVPN RSA scripts for X509 certificate management
        * `/SELECT_PATH=1`                : Add OpenVPN executable directory to the current user's PATH
        * `/SELECT_SHORTCUTS=1`           : Add OpenVPN shortcuts to the current user's Start Menu
        * `/SELECT_LAUNCH=1`              : Launch OpenVPN GUI on user logon
        * `/SELECT_OPENSSLDLLS=1`         : Install OpenSSL DLLs locally (may be omitted if DLLs are already installed globally)
        * `/SELECT_LZODLLS=1`             : Install LZO DLLs locally (may be omitted if DLLs are already installed globally)
        * `/SELECT_PKCS11DLLS=1`          : Install PKCS#11 helper DLLs locally (may be omitted if DLLs are already installed globally)

        The only difference with the default package configuration is the EASYRSA option enabled while the default install disables it.

        In order to be started automatically, your configuration still needs to reside in C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config\.
        By design, OpenVPN-GUI does not show connections started automatically; it only shows connections started by the current user.
